This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.  An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  ### Impact  Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.   ### Original Report  This security issue was reported by: - GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck - Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi"}]}, {"name": "chromadb-client", "version": "1.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "psutil", "version": "6.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyjwt", "version": "2.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "passlib", "version": "1.7.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest", "version": "8.3.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-asyncio", "version": "0.24.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-cov", "version": "5.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-jose", "version": "3.3.0", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2024-232", "fix_versions": ["3.4.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-6c5p-j8vq-pqhj", "CVE-2024-33663"], "description": "python-jose through 3.3.0 has algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys and other key formats.

This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render a service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette.  ### PoC  ```python from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.routing import Route  async def poc(request):     async with request.form():         pass  app = Starlette(routes=[     Route('/', poc, methods=[\"POST\"]), ]) ```  ```sh curl http://localhost:8000 -F 'big=</dev/urandom' ```  ### Impact This Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (or FastAPI) accepting form requests.

This blocks the event thread which means we can't accept new connections.  ### Details Please see this discussion for details: https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/2927#discussioncomment-13721403. In summary the following UploadFile code (copied from [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/fa5355442753f794965ae1af0f87f9fec1b9a3de/starlette/datastructures.py#L436C5-L447C14)) has a minor bug. Instead of just checking for `self._in_memory` we should also check if the additional bytes will cause a rollover.  ```python      @property     def _in_memory(self) -> bool:         # check for SpooledTemporaryFile._rolled         rolled_to_disk = getattr(self.file, \"_rolled\", True)         return not rolled_to_disk      async def write(self, data: bytes) -> None:         if self.size is not None:             self.size += len(data)          if self._in_memory:             self.file.write(data)         else:             await run_in_threadpool(self.file.write, data) ```  I have already created a PR which fixes the problem: https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2962   ### PoC See the discussion [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/2927#discussioncomment-13721403) for steps on how to reproduce.  ### Impact To be honest, very low and not many users will be impacted. Parsing large forms is already CPU intensive so the additional IO block doesn't slow down `starlette` that much on systems with modern HDDs/SSDs. If someone is running on tape they might see a greater impact."}]}, {"name": "bcrypt", "version": "5.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "coverage", "version": "7.13.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ecdsa", "version": "0.19.1", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2024-23342", "fix_versions": [], "aliases": ["GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp"], "description": "python-ecdsa has been found to be subject to a Minerva timing attack on the P-256 curve.
